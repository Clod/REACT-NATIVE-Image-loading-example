# React Native Image Loading Issue Analysis and Resolution

## Initial Problem
The application experienced image loading issues specifically on Android devices while working correctly on iOS. The error message indicated:
```
Error while updating property 'source' of a view managed by: RCTImageView
java.lang.Double cannot be cast to com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableArray
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Platform Differences
- iOS and Android handle image loading differently in React Native
- Android is more strict about type checking and image source handling
- The error occurred after an Expo update, suggesting version compatibility issues

### 2. Technical Details
The issue stemmed from several factors:
- Image source type casting problems on Android
- Caching mechanism differences between platforms
- React Native's image loading implementation variations between iOS and Android

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Package Updates
First, we updated the project dependencies to ensure compatibility:
```json
{
  "expo": "^52.0.35",
  "react-native-fast-image": "latest"
}
```

### 2. Image Component Replacement
We replaced the standard React Native Image component with FastImage:

Before:
```javascript
<Image 
  source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }}
  style={styles.workoutImage}
/>
```

After:
```javascript
<FastImage
  source={{
    uri: item.imageUrl,
    priority: FastImage.priority.normal,
    cache: FastImage.cacheControl.immutable
  }}
  style={styles.workoutImage}
  resizeMode={FastImage.resizeMode.cover}
  fallback={true}
  defaultSource={require('./assets/icon.png')}
/>
```

### 3. Key Improvements
1. **Better Caching**: FastImage provides consistent caching behavior across platforms
2. **Performance**: Optimized image loading and memory management
3. **Reliability**: More robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified behavior between iOS and Android

## Why It Works
1. FastImage uses native image loading libraries on both platforms
2. It implements proper type handling for image sources
3. It provides better memory management and caching
4. It handles network requests more efficiently

## Best Practices for Future Development
1. Always use FastImage for remote image loading in React Native
2. Implement proper error handling and fallback images
3. Consider platform-specific optimizations when needed
4. Keep dependencies updated to maintain compatibility

## Additional Considerations
- Monitor image loading performance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider implementing progressive image loading for larger images
- Use appropriate image sizes and formats for mobile devices

## Conclusion
The image loading issues were resolved by:
1. Using a more robust image loading library (FastImage)
2. Implementing proper caching strategies
3. Adding fallback mechanisms
4. Ensuring consistent behavior across platforms

This solution not only fixed the immediate issue but also improved the overall image loading performance and reliability of the application.
